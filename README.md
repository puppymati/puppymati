## Hai, I'm Matilde

I'm a systems programmer based in Europe, mostly writing Rust and occasionally messing
with Gleam. I like re-building things from the ground up, hopefully to make them better.

Currently working on a compositor, a few bootloaders, package managers, and a couple of programming languages.

I'm also interested in making a new Linux environment, for which I maintain a Rust target [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support/x86_64-unknown-linux-none.html).

You can find me at [matilde.pet](https://matilde.pet).
